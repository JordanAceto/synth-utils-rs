# Rust Synth-Utils

## Lightweight modulation sources and utilities for music synthesizers

This crate does not provide any sound generation, only control and modulation sources.

The intended use is in small real time embedded applications. For example, a desktop synthesizer with analog signal path
and digital envelopes, LFOs, and MIDI-to-CV.
